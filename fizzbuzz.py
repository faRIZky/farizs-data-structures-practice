        if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
            print("FizzBuzz")
        elif number % 3 == 0:

'''
Why FizzBuzz is Placed First in the Logic???

When a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, we want "FizzBuzz". 
So, we have to check for this case first to avoid missing it. 

If we place the conditions for "Fizz" and "Buzz" first, theyâ€™ll trigger 
when the number is a multiple of 3 or 5 alone and skip the "FizzBuzz" check.
